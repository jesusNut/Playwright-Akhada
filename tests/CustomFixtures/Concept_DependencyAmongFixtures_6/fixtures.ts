//!ðŸ’° There are certain scenarios where we want to make sure than Fixture 1 is always set up before Fixture 2.
//!ðŸ’° For example : Lets say we when we click a link on 'FirstPage'  it opens a new 'SecondPage' in a new tab.
//!ðŸ’° In 'fixtures.ts' file, I want that 'FirstPage' is always configured BEFORE 'SecondPage' is configured.
//!ðŸ’° Same concept is used in notes : while "Integrating New Window/New tab scenario in Framework"

//!==================================================================================================================

//* ðŸ¤ª Playwright ensures that the 'FirstPage/fixture1' is executed before the 'SecondPage/fixture2' because 'SecondPage/fixture2' depends on 'FirstPage/fixture1' in 'fixtures.ts' file.
//* ðŸ¤ª Playwright's test runner resolves fixtures based on their dependencies.
//* ðŸ¤ª Since 'SecondPage/fixture2' waits for the 'FirstPage/fixture1' to perform an action , it inherently guarantees that 'FirstPage/fixture1' is fully set up before 'SecondPage/fixture2' starts its setup.


//* ðŸ¤ª The 'SecondPage/fixture2' will be torn down before the 'FirstPage/fixture1' fixture. 
//* ðŸ¤ª Playwright's test runner tears down fixtures in the reverse order of their setup.
//* ðŸ¤ª Since 'SecondPage/fixture2' depends on 'FirstPage/fixture1' and is set up after 'FirstPage/fixture1', it will be torn down first.
