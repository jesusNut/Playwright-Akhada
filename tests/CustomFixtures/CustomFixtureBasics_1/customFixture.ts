//! 1. ðŸ’° Use test.extend() method to create custom fixtures
//! 2. ðŸ’° Fixtures can we used inside tests, before and after hooks also.
//! 3. ðŸ’° Fixtures are mainly used with page object classes.
//! 4. ðŸ’° Fixtures are preferred over before and after hooks.
//! 5. ðŸ’° While implementing fixtures using extend method, we can provide value of fixture(assuming fixture to be a key) or we can provide
//!       an async function.
//! 6. ðŸ’° The argument passed inside the use() method is passed to the tests/before hooks/after hooks (wherever that fixture is used)

//! ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ If the type of any of the property is 'any' type, then while implementing that fixture using an async function
//! in the extend method, the pre-defined fixtures like page, browser, context etc. will not work. ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
